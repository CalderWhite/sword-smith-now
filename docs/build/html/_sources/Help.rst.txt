2.1 When reading...
-------------------

Things to remember when you read the documentation

2.1.1 Names
~~~~~~~~~~~

This may correspond to class names, function names, object names property names. The list goes on.

2.1.1.1 Objects and classes
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

When reading, you may come across a keyword that should be left on its own, but it has its filename infront of it

Example::
	
	runtime.gui
	   |	  |
	  _/      \_
	filename    classname

Even though you'd normally call it without the filename, the filename is just there do differentiate from another file's class with the same name.

2.1.1.2 Organization
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Just so it's in writing, ``>`` usually denotes a subsection of another container.

Example::
	
	launcher>functions
